A DB migration program focused on safety
and supporting zero down time deployments.

== GOALS ==
Deploy DB changes separated into phases:
* add new schema elements
* (not pygrate): deploy new application code
* hide old schema elements to simulate dropping
* permanently drop old schema elements

Easily rollback added and hidden elements

Segregate DB changes by "release", to limit how far a rollback can go

Support various types of migrations:
* add/drop table
* add/drop column
* add/drop stored procedure
* add/drop view
* add/drop index
* add/drop constraint
* grant/revoke
