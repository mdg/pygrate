A DB migration program focused on safety
and supporting zero down time deployments.


== GOALS ==
Deploy DB changes separated into phases:
* add new schema elements
* (not pygrate): deploy new application code
* hide old schema elements to simulate dropping
* permanently drop old schema elements

Easily rollback added and hidden elements

Segregate DB changes by "release", to limit how much can be rolled back


== USAGE ==
pygrate <operation> <release>

<operation> is one of:
* add
* hide
* drop
* rollback_add
* rollback_hide

<release> references the group of files to execute


== Pygrations ==
each database change is implemented in a subclass of the Pygration class.
the pygration subclass has a method for each operation.  that method will
get called by pygrate when it's run.


== SUPPORTED DB OPERATIONS ==
* add/drop table
* add/drop column
* add/drop stored procedure
* add/drop view
* add/drop index
* add/drop constraint
* grant/revoke
