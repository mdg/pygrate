provide PrefixStep and PostfixStep as part of each migration

make it more tolerant of Step renames
	this includes a persistent ID value probably
	rather than a persistent ID, turn it into a DeletedStep
	The DeletedStep will let it be rolled back by anyone no matter
	what they've migrated

pygration_state table should have dates for add, simdrop, drop

error out if the given migration version doesn't exist

fix rollback so it doesn't break when its already been rolled back

error out if trying to execute versions or steps out of sequence


log which sql is executed
	might just need a hash, some DBs (oracle) won't be able to hold
	everything
report error if steps in a migration change since it was run

migrate a phase for all steps
	probably don't want to do this, but rather migrate each phase
	for all steps.  used for bringing the DB up to date from scratch.
