make it more tolerant of Step renames
	this includes a persistent ID value probably
	rather than a persistent ID, turn it into a DeletedStep
	The DeletedStep will let it be rolled back by anyone no matter
	what they've migrated

fix rollback so it doesn't break when its already been rolled back

provide PrefixStep and PostfixStep as part of each migration

pygration_state table should have timestamps for add, simdrop, drop

store which sql is executed in pygration_state
	might just need a hash, some DBs (oracle) won't be able to hold
	everything
report error if steps in a migration change since it was run

write outcomes to a log file
	log should be configurable

migrate individual steps or groups of steps
	pygrate add v1.AddTable

interface to repair the pygration_state table
	will need to alter the pygration_state table w/o running migrations
	maybe call a step run, or rollback & delete a state row that is
	invalid for some reason now

add templates for sql and sql files
	make it plugable to support different template engines
	default to mako, other candidates include django & jsontemplate
	put template data section into yaml config that is accessible from
	the template

add pre and post checks to each phase to verify correctness
	check that db is in expected state prior to migrating
	and that it's in expected state after migrating

explicitly set dependencies between steps within a migration
	this lets things be stored in a more organization order
	rather than always having to be put at the end which may not be
	the clearest option
