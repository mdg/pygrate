make it more tolerant of Step renames
	this includes a persistent ID value probably
	rather than a persistent ID, turn it into a DeletedStep
	The DeletedStep will let it be rolled back by anyone no matter
	what they've migrated

fix rollback so it doesn't break when its already been rolled back

provide PrefixStep and PostfixStep as part of each migration

pygration_state table should have dates for add, simdrop, drop

log which sql is executed
	might just need a hash, some DBs (oracle) won't be able to hold
	everything
report error if steps in a migration change since it was run

migrate individual steps or groups of steps
	pygrate add v1.AddTable

migrate a phase for all steps
	probably don't want to do this, but rather migrate each phase
	for all steps.  used for bringing the DB up to date from scratch.

explicitly set dependencies between steps within a migration
	this lets things be stored in a more organization order
	rather than always having to be put at the end which may not be
	the clearest option
